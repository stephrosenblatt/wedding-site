              <h3>The Bride <span>Stephanie Marjorie Rosenblatt</span></h3>
              <p>Stephanie was born and raised in Coconut Creek, FL. After high school, she left to study journalism at the University of Florida -- and will forever hold not only a passion for journalism, but also for her alma mater. (GO GATORS!) She worked for the Miami Herald for a few years, including during the 2008 election; later, she transitioned from being a multimedia journalist to working full-time in web application development.</p>
              <p>She grew up surfing the waves of Deerfield Beach, FL, and considers running a marathon, co-founding and curating <a href="http://tedxmiami.com" target="_blank">TEDxMiami</a> (Florida's first <a href="http://ted.com" target="_blank">TED</a> branch), and finding the man of her dreams as a few of her most major accomplishments. In a challenge of wits about craft beer or whiskey, she can contend with the best - perhaps it's her German, English and Irish heritage that gives her a leg up. She's also been known to book her vacations around two things: outdoor adventures and music concerts.</p>
              <p>Steph believes that mountains are for climbing and life is for discovering.</p>

              <h3>The Groom <span>Frank Raymond Serafine</span></h3>
              <p>Frank was born and raised in San Antonio, TX, with an intrinsic knack for the creative and the conceptual. After high school, he moved to Nashville to study music and business at Belmont University, and landed himself a seat at one of the three major music royalty companies, SESAC. Frank's musical proclivity spans the genre gamut -- from crooner classics, to his solo release called Flight Plan, to his latest endeavour, a doom metal project called Northern Crown.</p>
              <p>His penchant for bringing new, unique creations into this world doesn't stop there, though. He's a top-notch chef who's always trying new combinations of foods and spices (though will attempt to add mint to just about anything), and if you invite this Polish-Italian man into your home, you can almost guarantee to find him in your kitchen more than willing to help out.</p>
              <p>Frank also loves adventures and traveling, and aims to see the world alongside his family with a smile on his face and a song in his heart.</p>

              <p>With the dashing Frank Serafine hailing from Nashville and Stephanie from South Florida, we serendipitously were introduced two years ago at our mutual annual concert pilgrimage, ProgPower USA, in Atlanta by our mutual friend Dave. If you ask both of us, we remember briefly meeting each other and taking a second glance, but it wasn't until the year after that everything clicked. Our friend circles overlapped, and over a few days of craft beer, rocking out to bands from all over the world, and great conversations, we knew this wasn't something ordinary anymore.</p>
              <p>Although we both headed back to our home cities, that very same night we struck up conversation via messaging because, well...we couldn't wait a whole year to see each other again!</p>
              <p>From that night on, we wrote each other back and forth every evening. The pages stacked up, and hours of writing turned into hours of phone calls.</p>
              <p>More than 400 days later, we've never missed a night of talking on the phone when we're not with each other.</p>
              <p>The rest, as they say, is history. We've had countless adventures, trips, and concerts, and with great family and friends surrounding us, and we're so thankful to have every single one of you support a love that will last beyond our lifetime.</p>
