                <h3>How Steph Remembers It</h3>
                <p>It was a Saturday morning, sunny, warm and slightly breezy in downtown Nashville. Frank's mom was also in town, and the plan was for the three of us to hit the town and spend some quality time together. It all seemed perfectly ordinary and perfectly wonderful.
                </p><p>
                We were headed out to brunch. As approached the Tennessee Titans stadium, we realized that it was Game Day - and the parking lots were packed! The agitation in Frank's voice as he realized this "roadbump" was surpressed but apparent. From the backseat, I placed my hand on Frank's shoulder and told him, "Babe, it's no big deal, it's just a parking spot. We'll drive for a while and find an area."
                </p><p>
                The irony. Little did I know everything he had planned! 
                </p><p>
                Finally, we found a parking spot and headed up the pedestrian bridge. Frank and Patricia were so casual about how they did it, but they kept urging me across the bridge by suggesting the best overlook was on the other side.
                </p><p>
                Suddenly, I hear a very familiar male voice shout, "Steph!" It takes my brain to process it. Who would I possibly know who is on the bridge in Nashville? Did I mishear? Was there another Stephanie? 
                </p><p>
                "Steph!"
                </p><p>
                I look up and to the left, and I see my mom and dad slowly walking toward me. My dad has the iPad in hand, holding it up like a camera. My mom waves.
                </p><p>
                My mind goes blank. "What are you guys doing here?!?" I stammered. I didn't know they were in town, and I sure as heck didn't know why. I thought they were going to be in Orlando!
                </p><p>
                An acoustic guitar starts strumming behind me. At that moment, it clicks. <em>It's happening, now. This is really happening.</em> I can hardly process it. Too many emotions were firing at once: surprise, joy, disbelief, love... it was blowing my mind.
                </p><p>
                I turn around to see these two beautiful people, a couple -- Carolina Story, I now know -- swaying as they start singing a song that is also familiar, and special:
                </p><p><em>
                "You are my story,
                my fame and my glory,
                heaven unfolding....
                You're all I ever wanted, oooooohhh"
                </em></p><p>
                Frank is standing next to them, the grinning wide as the moment had finally come. 
                </p><p>
                When he jumped in to harmonize with Carolina Story on the second verse, half of me was listening and half of me was repeating mentally: "Yes, yes, yes, I do!"
                </p><p>
                And when he asked, it was all I could do to wait until he finished popping the question to tell him that of course, yes, of course I do, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
                </p><p>
                Frank crafted the proposal of every girl's dreams and kept the whole thing under wraps, and despite not being a fan of surprises, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm also not sure if I'll ever get over how deadpan I look in the video as I attempt to process everything. It's hilarious.
                </p><p>
                I don't know how he managed it. I'm one lucky woman.
