                <h3>How Frank Planned It</h3>
                <p>I wanted our families to be involved because family is super important to me, although this meant I had to be pretty strategic about the date and location. I had two plans, just in case bad weather forced us inside, and although there were a bunch of moving parts to them, I knew I could get them lined up.</p>
                <p>Early on in our relationship, Steph and I had developed a mutual love of a band called “Johnnyswim,” which we saw together in Nashville on one very special night. While not her favorite song of theirs, I knew that “A Million Years” was going to be my proposal song because of the chorus lyrics: “You’re all I ever wanted, ooh ooh ooh ooh / You’re all I ever wanted, ooh ooh ooh ooh.”</p>
                <p>At an early date, Steph and I went to Nashville’s Centennial Park to see a band called The Vespers play during a Musician’s Corner concert, so I had contacted & tried to get The Vespers to sing during my proposal. This didn’t work out due to members being in different places, but their guitarist recommended me the country duo ‘Carolina Story,’ who already had Grand Ole Opry rapport (the oldest, most-esteemed stage in country music.)</p>
                <p>I picked the Nashville pedestrian bridge as the location for both scenic (obviously!) and symbolic reasons. Our marriage is not only a joining together of our two hearts, but a uniting of our two families in a shared future. I wanted the bridge to symbolize that we’d be “bridging the gap” between families with this. (Oooh, I can hear Steph groaning at that pun now!) I wanted my mother and Steph’s parents at least, if we couldn’t get her brother as well, with us for the proposal for that reason.</p>
                <p>I had one challenge: Steph is REALLY hard to surprise. I arranged with her folks to have them fly in for the proposal, unbeknownst to Steph, and take a little Nashville vacation while they were at it, not revealing themselves until the big day.</p>
                <p>Without too much stress, our parents and I managed to keep it together and somehow ensure that Steph didn’t suspect a thing. She thought we were just going to walk the bridge downtown over to brunch on the other side. She got a lot more than she bargained for!</p>
                <p>It came down to it and I got down on one knee and asked her to marry me. It was the happiest moment of my entire life and the confirmation of everything that I knew about love in the world. I chose her, she chose me, and we will spend the rest of our lives choosing whoever we become come whatever may and growing together. Forever.</p>
                <p>I tried to tone down my romanticism here. I really did, but you know me. All heart!</p>

                <h3>How Steph Remembers It</h3>
                <p>It was a Saturday morning, sunny, warm and slightly breezy in downtown Nashville. Frank's mom was also in town, and the plan was for the three of us to hit the town and spend some quality time together. It all seemed perfectly ordinary and perfectly wonderful.
                </p><p>
                We were headed out to brunch. As approached the Tennessee Titans stadium, we realized that it was Game Day - and the parking lots were packed! The agitation in Frank's voice as he realized this "roadbump" was surpressed but apparent. From the backseat, I placed my hand on Frank's shoulder and told him, "Babe, it's no big deal, it's just a parking spot. We'll drive for a while and find an area."
                </p><p>
                The irony. Little did I know everything he had planned! 
                </p><p>
                Finally, we found a parking spot and headed up the pedestrian bridge. Frank and Patricia were so casual about how they did it, but they kept urging me across the bridge by suggesting the best overlook was on the other side.
                </p><p>
                Suddenly, I hear a very familiar male voice shout, "Steph!" It takes my brain to process it. Who would I possibly know who is on the bridge in Nashville? Did I mishear? Was there another Stephanie? 
                </p><p>
                "Steph!"
                </p><p>
                I look up and to the left, and I see my mom and dad slowly walking toward me. My dad has the iPad in hand, holding it up like a camera. My mom waves.
                </p><p>
                My mind goes blank. "What are you guys doing here?!?" I stammered. I didn't know they were in town, and I sure as heck didn't know why. I thought they were going to be in Orlando!
                </p><p>
                An acoustic guitar starts strumming behind me. At that moment, it clicks. <em>It's happening, now. This is really happening.</em> I can hardly process it. Too many emotions were firing at once: surprise, joy, disbelief, love... it was blowing my mind.
                </p><p>
                I turn around to see these two beautiful people, a couple -- Carolina Story, I now know -- swaying as they start singing a song that is also familiar, and special:
                </p><p><em>
                "You are my story,
                my fame and my glory,
                heaven unfolding....
                You're all I ever wanted, oooooohhh"
                </em></p><p>
                Frank is standing next to them, the grinning wide as the moment had finally come. 
                </p><p>
                When he jumped in to harmonize with Carolina Story on the second verse, half of me was listening and half of me was repeating mentally: "Yes, yes, yes, I do!"
                </p><p>
                And when he asked, it was all I could do to wait until he finished popping the question to tell him that of course, yes, of course I do, I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
                </p><p>
                Frank crafted the proposal of every girl's dreams and kept the whole thing under wraps, and despite not being a fan of surprises, I wouldn't have it any other way. I'm also not sure if I'll ever get over how deadpan I look in the video as I attempt to process everything. It's hilarious.
                </p><p>
                I don't know how he managed it. I'm one lucky woman.
